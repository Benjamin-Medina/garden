Examples: an economics class using Money 
To demonstrate taxes. Or in a longer experiment, the currency of actions.
Bathroom break cost $.25, and paper cost $.10. Good actions occur grants $2. On time assignment incomes $1. Etc

What about popular sovereignty? Demonstrating the process of legislation. 
The teacher is in the military, and able to sway the bureaucratic process, and even overthrow it yesterday and ineffective.
Is a parliamentary system in which a coalition is needed to pass legislation? Most likely, so that legislation should be passed more easily.
They were going to be term limits though, as to not have a majority of power the whole time, being that there wouldn’t necessarily be elections of representatives, as each student one for themselves. This exposes the adjustments needed to be made when considering the vote as a citizen, and the votes as a representative in the legislator. 

Is the lining of the class governmental structure to the United States is desired, then special considerations need to be put in to the previous sentence. What are you want to avoid is a popularity contest, particularly for the office of the president. Then there’s the class-size and establishing a bicameral system, so not easily established, especially when votes need to be a plurality. 

In both a parliamentary and presidential system, the teacher could be the executive branch entirely, rather than just the military. In this way, the teacher could military coup when see fit, while also propose legislation or at the least the agenda for the legislative. 

Maybe, the simple act of voting, without the complexity of bureaucracy is best. 
Is it based on plurality, so the majority of the votes win. Or is it based on ring choice voting, so certain threshold.

What is the purpose of this effort?

I believe that a game, or experiment of this nature will certainly engage the students in the basic areas of governance. But I also hope is that, and this is where the thought came from, rules and behaviors would be shaped by the decisions of the students, that’s enhancing the prospect of buying.
