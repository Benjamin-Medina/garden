Seeds within my [[Digital Garden]] need to be tended to on the regular, or 
they'll die; no germination into a sapling, nor reach evergreen status. 

Plants don't reach their full potential out of **choice** and not forgetfulness.

Set a routine to check your garden daily, twice a week, or however often it takes to manage its growth; cultivated plants grow unsightly when left to their own devices. This endeavor is ignored when it becomes a chore, so thwart the overgrowth by continuously cultivating seeds and saplings.
