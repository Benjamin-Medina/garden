I am talking about the task of teachers to detect emotional or mental hardships in their students.\n\nFor context, I have directly connected with at least two students while working as a substitute teacher at Johnson High School; both seemed mentally ambiguous. In one case I spoke one-on-one with the student to advise against their dangerous actions and disruptive language. With the other, they sweep the room and asked for anything to do to keep their mind busy. I directed their attention to a book I had with me called the _Humans of San Antonio_. Near the end of the period, I engaged in conversation about the book and their desire to be an occupational interests. \n\nThere are students that might not show a care or effort towards my class work, but that‚Äôs likely due to outside forces more than any gripe at my instruction or material. There‚Äôs the conditions of life (hardships), or the lack of cultivation in the beauty of learning. Some may never have the latter, choosing to construct industry on their mental landscape, or something else entirely.\n\nDealing with situations out of the ordinary, or conduct activities outside of the rigidity of lecturing is scary. Yet, those are some of the aspects that make the occupation so rewarding, and produce the worthwhile feelings that only a challenge brings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-16T22:15:24.513648884Z","tags":null},"/notes/Bonding-through-music":{"title":"Bonding through music","content":"\nPatricia S.

In this way, the teacher could military coup when see fit, while also propose legislation or at the least the agenda for the legislative. \n\nMaybe, the simple act of voting, without the complexity of bureaucracy is best. \nIs it based on plurality, so the majority of the votes win. Or is it based on ring choice voting, so certain threshold.\n\nWhat is the purpose of this effort?\n\nI believe that a game, or experiment of this nature will certainly engage the students in the basic areas of governance.

Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.\n\nI've personally found that\n1.

It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*\n\nI was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.\n\n**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-16T22:15:24.529649118Z","tags":null},"/notes/search":{"title":"Search","content":"\nQuartz supports two modes of searching through content.\n\n## Full-text\nFull-text search is the default in Quartz. It produces results that *exactly* match the search query. This is easier to setup but usually produces lower quality matches.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: false\n```\n\n## Natural Language\nNatural language search is powered by [Operand](https://operand.ai/). It understands language like a person does and finds results that best match user intent. In this sense, it is closer to how Google Search works.\n\nNatural language search tends to produce higher quality results than full-text search.\n\nHere's how to set it up.\n\n1. Create an Operand Account on [their website](https://operand.ai/).\n2. Go to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e Integrations.\n3. Follow the steps to setup the GitHub integration. Operand needs access to GitHub in order to index your digital garden properly!\n4. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar and select 'Create Collection'.\n\t1. Set the 'Collection Label' to something that will help you remember it.\n\t2. You can leave the 'Parent Collection' field empty.\n5. Click into your newly made Collection.\n\t1. Press the 'share' button that looks like three dots connected by lines.\n\t2. Set the 'Interface Type' to `object-search` and click 'Create'.\n\t3. This will bring you to a new page with a search bar. Ignore this for now.\n6. Go back to Dashboard \u003e Settings \u003e API Keys and find your Quartz-specific Operand API key under 'Other keys'.\n\t1. Copy the key (which looks something like `0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910`).\n\t2. Open `data/config.yaml`. Set `enableSemanticSearch` to `true` and `operandApiKey` to your copied key.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# the default option\nenableSemanticSearch: true\noperandApiKey: \"0e733a7f-9b9c-48c6-9691-b54fa1c8b910\"\n```\n7. Make a commit and push your changes to GitHub. See the [[notes/hosting|hosting]] page if you haven't done this already.\n\t1. This step is *required* for Operand to be able to properly index your content. \n\t2. Head over to Dashboard \u003e Objects and select the collection that you made earlier\n8. Press `(Cmd + K)` to open the omnibar again and select 'Create GitHub Repo'\n\t1. Set the 'Repository Label' to `Quartz`\n\t2. Set the 'Repository Owner' to your GitHub username\n\t3. Set the 'Repository Ref' to `master`\n\t4. Set the 'Repository Name' to the name of your repository (usually just `quartz` if you forked the repository without changing the name)\n\t5. Leave 'Root Path' and 'Root URL' empty\n9. Wait for your repository to index and enjoy natural language search in Quartz! Operand refreshes the index every 2h so all you need to do is just push to GitHub to update the contents in the search.","lastmodified":"2022-11-16T22:15:24.529649118Z","tags":null},"/notes/the-cultural-conditions-of-television":{"title":"the cultural conditions of television","content":"\n[[1960s America]], arguably, holds a certain ore as a highly cultural period, full of diverse appearances, mindsets, and manner of existence.
