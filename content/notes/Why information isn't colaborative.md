If academic literature is supposed to be “discourse” and a conversation with others, why isn’t it using a collaborative modal of dissemination? 

Pride?
Honor? 
Justification for a length degree? 

I’d love to experiment with [[Digital Garden]]ing as a means of creating conversation and sparking new ideas within the humanities.
