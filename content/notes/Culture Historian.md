Statements like these in literature bequeaths the biggest "hmmm" out of me because it's a connection of the physical to the mental. It invokes a linear Journey of the coffee bean as a seed, to harvesting by servants, then transported, consumed by the European individual, In wrapping that all up under cultural terms or feelings. 

[[epistemology|epistemologically]] there's no definitive way of stating this without making inferences, or having a personal document stating thus. Even if such a document existed, it likely would not say this verbatim, and could be in a separate language in the reader.

* reading between the lines, what's not being said 
* Translation differences

Interestingly [[Ruhl1997]] makes a similar claim but about Oranges in *La Florida*
