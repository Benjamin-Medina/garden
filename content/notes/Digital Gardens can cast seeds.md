[[Digital Garden]]’s have the ability to cast [seeds](/tags/seed) across their landscape, just like an acorn falling on the ground.  Sometimes that acorn embeds itself to the forest floor, germinates, and sprouts dense life out of abundant organic nutrients. 

Other times, the acorn just falls. Maybe a bird or squirrel picks it up and eats it. 🤷‍♂️
