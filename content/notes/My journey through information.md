I like [[Reading Books]]; they're a learning experience. My excitement for reading festers into a desire to write, and share. [[I write to discover myself]]. 
	ravenous animal about information and slowly forming that input to knowledge 

How do I convert that into output? 
Could the world experience a renaissance of academic writing? A field guarded with degree sized walls, impassive to the free thinkers. We see shifts happened at the instruction level, with massive online courses, and experience fresh ideas from our hyper-connected (via internet) world.
