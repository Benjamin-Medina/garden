Humans are curious, this pushes energy to learning, and knowledge accrual. Examine this self motivating style with conventional methods of instruction (classroom and workplace). In these settings, a top-down verbal synopsis is rendered, with the misguided intent of educating the "lower." Which is a mentality of being the most enlightened and thwarting intellectual challenges. 

In a classroom, this leads to unenthused students, and reduced retention. Instead, the teacher should simply be nurturing enthusiasm and guiding pain-points. 

Managers have a similar responsibility, but routinely seek control of all aspects, which chokes out motivation and innovation. Then this places all burden onto "the one" producing inefficiency and burnout. 

ðŸ’­ Think about you might apply this to your career as a teacher/educator. Question convention, for the grass may be greener on the other side.
