I believe education over emphasizes descriptive writing. The scholarly writing I seek to pen is out of reach, because I perceive it as so rigid; ingrained in literary rules. 

I interact with essays in anti-conformist, partly out of frustration for not feeling competent in it, so rogue execution is better than nothing; then from an understanding of constructs and the malleability of them. 

It's possible I simply want to reverse roles with the constructs of my subjection, so that I be liberated from anxiety and "not-good-enough".
