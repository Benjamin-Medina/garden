# Hello
Welcome to my digital garden. It's a bit messy, unlike the manicured web spaces we call blogs, but it's intentionally that way. What's the [[notes/philosophy behind the garden]]?

Some ideas are only [seeds](/tags/seed) - in the ground, but minimally germinated

They'll start to grow into [saplings](/tags/sapling) - slight foliage adorns these thoughts, but they aren't...
[evergreen](/tags/evergreen) - the grandad of the forest, the mega redwood sequoia towering with time and wisdom. 


## Get Started

A great place to start is with my [[notes/Index - Education]]

Perhaps you want to know the inspiration behind note-taking through links and atomicity. In that case, check out [[notes/Zettelkasten Method]]. 

Oh... you're still here? Well in that case, you want to [[notes/The Roman Empire Fell, but Rome didnâ€™t]]
