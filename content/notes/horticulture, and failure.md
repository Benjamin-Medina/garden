Horticulture is exposing all my deepest emotions of failure! 

Transplanting teenage plants into a large bed, exposed to me to observers, shunting my social fortitude. 

Seeds have been my garden start of choice, and it's economically viable. Whereas $20, $35 priced plants nail my gripe of spending every moment they seem to be dying. 

I feel sad that my front bed isn't turning out well - wilting transplants, seeds not germinating - because I deem the outcome as my failure, and thrash myself mentally with nails of financial and social ruin!
