[Morning Routine of Andy Matuschuk](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3x7AvJgYzmgEY4kcKdSY2aYxdqWYpTyPqRs8)

I really like his schedule. Time boxing!
Creative black in the morning, seldom working on “tasks” which he reserves for his later (third block). It’s fascinating and slightly spontaneous. 

I’m still not certain how my daily journal plays into my daily flow…. That’s ok. For now 🙃 lol

Anyways, I’m a bit amiss as to the right time to document a fleeting thought with a small zettle or grab it all on daily notes like above 👆🏼 

Andy spends his four hour morning block of writing and creativity to stroll through his inbox notes. Which is simply a field of sprouts - so germinated - and require nutrients to continue their journey to plant hood.
