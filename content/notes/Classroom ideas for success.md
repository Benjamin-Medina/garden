Here are some ideas for your future classroom to help ensure success for all parties. (You, students, and subs) 

1 - seating charts with student photos are really nice. They Help separate the problem groups, and make it easy for students to select their seat today. Lastly the attendance for myself and especially for substitute teachers is aided with it.

2 - Reduction of paper. They will need to be a fine line between not providing materials for your classroom and providing too much. [[Technology to aid environmental impact|Environmentally]], excess paper is not good. There’s also the issue of organization regards to grading and subsequently keeping the papers.

3 - classroom procedures visibly listed in the room. This just ensures that students are always reminded of the classroom expectations.

4 - A bathroom whiteboard, or possibly better, a software with time keeping capacity. Who is the former, a visible name and time with the student left clear enough for me to see from anywhere in the room is helpful. Lastly, a sanitary hall pass… the lanyard is easily lost, but a held item can quickly become dirty.
