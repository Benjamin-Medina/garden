# Obsidian Pro Tip

Well, today I learned how to Obsidian correctly, or at least in a deeper way! I've committed lots of time to improving my workflow - reference manager, note taker, composition - in large part to the weird presentation of links in Obsidian. I desire to work within one app, at least for the composition process, so that flow and concentration is retained within my writing app. Previously I've been switching back and forth between Obsidian, Zotero, PDF, and Safari. 

Also, writing mostly for school requires a standard of citation and presentation that isn't present out the gate, or so I thought.... I've spent time adjusting BetterBibtex cite keys to cope with in-text citations, but this wasn't friction proof, for the text would need to be moved to word, and footnote citations added via the Zotero integration. Then the wikilnks would clog up the material with a long name, a header reference, a block reference, or a combination of all three! 

Technology has improved around me, literally when the past month Zotero came out with a whole new update, adding a much desired PDF reader and mobile. Then a plugin came out for Obsidian, allowing for citation picking on par with Word. Finally, my connections have been improved with the use of a "|" pipe after my connected note name, allowing me to cultivate arbitrary names without the use of pandoc citations!

Oh, and I realized my block references weren't working as expected because I had my international keyboard output enabled.
