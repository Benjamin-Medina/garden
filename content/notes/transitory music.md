It’s interesting how music is appreciated in context rather than across environment The conditions of a song's initial encounter is seldom recreated, causing the feelings derived therein to be void in subsequent listens. 

Maybe it’s the communicative [[power of music]] that speaks to me in moments, of emotion, contemplation, or being. For example, a gospel song spoke to me at a youth trip, but wouldn't have the same effect today.
