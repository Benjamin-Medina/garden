Maybe academia is about legacy: scholars reject sharing notes or collaborating on their studies because it might dampen their light. Adjustments can be made, however, like recognizing dedication in an enhanced way or perceiving all knowledge as a utopian advancement of humanity. 

“I want to be best, to be first”, is a sentiment with [[baggage of academia]] and the institutional disadvantages of connecting [[worth and output]].
