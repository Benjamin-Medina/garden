Post-modernism may help in seeking to clarify work and identity: the values and state of being from the work we achieve. 

Reflect on [[Watkins|Ã†lfric's Colloquy]] and the honor of supplying a service to community and conceptualize the most honored of skills. Then relay the change over time to a centeredness in life, a unity with nature - [[feeling natural]] - which could be a detraction from Euro-colonial identities to an indigenous American ideal, or even a modern European construct of [[Work Life Balance]]. 

The older generation is always so proud of their work and remained in their jobs for long periods of time because of that intrinsically and contribution to society.
