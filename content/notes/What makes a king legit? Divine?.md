# King, Monarchs, Divinity? Oh My!
      
Is it weird to reference another dominion's leader as King? In Anglo-Saxon Chronicle number 871, the opposing leader in battle was referenced with the honorary of “king.” Yet, he was a "heathen kings Bagsecg." I ponder the connection of monarchy to divinity, and the recognition of different rulers with an honorary that's illegitimate within their referencing party’s own domain. 

Now I must consider the use of the title as simply denoting their place as leader of another group, which is to imply the linguistic indifference to another term. Furthermore, there may be a conflagration of "king" with respect to a "monarchy" - with the latter being a construct of the Renaissance with respect to their all encompassing power and divine right. 

Therefore, I must find the convergence of perpetual sovereignty, and singular dynasties. The explanation for the "royal" family of England (as an example) in sustaining monarchical grip over their territory for their respective reign.
