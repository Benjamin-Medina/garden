When I think about the first time I encountered Benedict [[Anderson1983]] "imagined communities," I instinctively think about [[PoliticalScience for the nation-state]], but the reading was initially assigned for a Modern Latin America course. This confusion is understandable, as I engaged, during the same semester, in a comparative politics course.

What I'm coming to realize is the lack of philosophical, sociological, or anthropological studies that occur in political science degrees, and etymology. I want to study government and politics, but not for the recitation of its facts, but for the **understanding** of its nuances in the interplay of those systems within society. That's where my political science class failed me. *Political science is not about culture, it's about science.* 

Humanities is about conceptualization and connecting the dots, where as Science likes to have solid evidence and proof. Therefore, Political Science is an oxymoron, as it routinely rejects interpretation of evidence like historian, in favor of experiments within their controlled environment. 

Why didn't I read about nationalism in my comparative politics class, a class dedicated to the understanding of the state? Because the class isn't about understanding legacy, but of interpreting the system as it stands. It's marginally a topic of acknowledging past mishaps, and more of a band wagon fan of any new modern bureaucracy.
