Today I identified my initial feelings and reactions to time off and Emily taking leave, and it's the idea of going on vacation. Which is time spent away from work needs, which I feel should be ***spent** wisely*, implying a disassociation of identify in work from personal care and the latter being equally worth of time well spent. 

Also, I recognized the people we are, in the scope of how we complete projects and being home bodies. I shared the idea of taking time off from work with the intention of working on the area we spend the majority of our lives, the four walls we call home, and its comfort we feel holistically grounded. 

What if we planned out a project like painting the living room, or replacing sink faucets over the course of a few weeks or months, then execute on those plans at a predetermined slot of time. We aren't weekend do'ers, but weekend relaxer. Albeit we enjoy working together (tasks and projects) and receive immense value in the beautification/upgrading of our primary residence. 

> Should we never take a vacation, but devote all our extra time and energy into our home? 

Not necessarily... but we can shift our mindset on the use of "vacation time and time off"
