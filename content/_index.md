# Hello
Welcome to my digital garden. It's a bit messy, unlike the manicured web spaces we call blogs, but it's intentionally that way. That means some links may not render correctly, editing might be needed, or the note is basic in content. 

What's the [[notes/philosophy behind the garden]]?

Some ideas are only [seeds](/tags/seed) - in the ground, but minimally germinated. They'll start to grow into [saplings](/tags/sapling) - slight foliage adorns these thoughts, produced by pruning and watering. Finally there's [evergreen](/tags/evergreen) - the grandad of the forest, the mega redwood sequoia towering with time and wisdom. 

## Get Started

A great place to start is with my [[notes/Index - Education]]

Perhaps you want to know the inspiration behind note-taking through links and atomicity. In that case, check out the [[notes/Zettelkasten Method]]. 

Oh... you're still here? Well in that case, you want to [[notes/The Roman Empire Fell, but Rome didnâ€™t]].
