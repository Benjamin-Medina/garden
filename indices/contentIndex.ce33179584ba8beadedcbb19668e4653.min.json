I am talking about the task of teachers to detect emotional or mental hardships in their students.\n\nFor context, I have directly connected with at least two students while working as a substitute teacher at Johnson High School; both seemed mentally ambiguous. In one case I spoke one-on-one with the student to advise against their dangerous actions and disruptive language. With the other, they sweep the room and asked for anything to do to keep their mind busy. I directed their attention to a book I had with me called the _Humans of San Antonio_. Near the end of the period, I engaged in conversation about the book and their desire to be an occupational interests. \n\nThere are students that might not show a care or effort towards my class work, but that‚Äôs likely due to outside forces more than any gripe at my instruction or material. There‚Äôs the conditions of life (hardships), or the lack of cultivation in the beauty of learning. Some may never have the latter, choosing to construct industry on their mental landscape, or something else entirely.\n\nDealing with situations out of the ordinary, or conduct activities outside of the rigidity of lecturing is scary. Yet, those are some of the aspects that make the occupation so rewarding, and produce the worthwhile feelings that only a challenge brings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-17T01:56:06.618360368Z","tags":null},"/notes/Bonding-through-music":{"title":"Bonding through music","content":"\nPatricia S.

The mind is attracted to the latest gadget, widget, or hack. \n\nI‚Äôd like to reflect on my current technological workflow - my progression of note-taking since diving deep into productivity and [[Kleon2014|Showing your work]]. The process started with the acquisition of the latest iPad; an investment into digital, cloud-stored, notes. My initial excitement was readily tampered by my hands constant fatigue for writing on a computerized display. Albeit, the true depressant came during writing assignment and processing of annotations. Alas, I persisted with my transformation from traditional pen and paper to an Apple Pencil and iPad (equip with a *Paperlike* screen laminate).\n\nEventually my workload became more intense, most notably my lengthy capstone [[Research Paper HIS]], which requires tremendous processing of dense academic literature. I took a step back, or rather a dive into, the digital academic space; stumbling upon Zotero and Obsidian, and a host of simulating procrastination gadgets. The more I added, the steeper my learning curve became, and the greater the friction between reading and processing information - mostly from the lack of synchronization between apps. \n\nThe cultivation of a flow State is paramount for my scholarly success, so at this junction of hand-writing and typing I'm faced with a conundrum. On the one hand, recording notes and highlighting pdfs on my Ipad is semi-traditional, so affords the least amount of resistance, during and post-consumption. For example, writing in the margin is my prompt action for recording new ideas; an action void in pure digital reading ecosystems. \n\nOn the other hand, I can embrace the typographic way of note-taking; automagically extracting and importing annotations into Obsidian and connecting the information to relevant notes. However, my concern for this workflow is the mass input of unfiltered ideas into [[Personal Knowledge Management]] tool. Will the mixing of academic and daily things produce negative outcomes? Can folders solve this problem without hindering the aesthetic and inherent benefits of Obsidian? \n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-11-17T01:56:06.618360368Z","tags":null},"/notes/Nationalism-in-Latin-American":{"title":"Nationalism in Latin American","content":"\nIsn‚Äôt it interesting that nationalism was and still is used by Latin American politics?

I've spent time adjusting BetterBibtex cite keys to cope with in-text citations, but this wasn't friction proof, for the text would need to be moved to word, and footnote citations added via the Zotero integration.

That's where my political science class failed me. *Political science is not about culture, it's about science.* \n\nHumanities is about conceptualization and connecting the dots, where as Science likes to have solid evidence and proof. Therefore, Political Science is an oxymoron, as it routinely rejects interpretation of evidence like historian, in favor of experiments within their controlled environment. \n\nWhy didn't I read about nationalism in my comparative politics class, a class dedicated to the understanding of the state?
