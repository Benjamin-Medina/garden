# Hello
Welcome to my digitial garden. It's a bit messy, but that's the intention. 

Some ideas are only [seeds] - in the ground, but minimally germinated
They'll start to grow into [saplings] - slight foliage adorns these thoughts, but they aren't...
[evergreen] - the grandad of the forest, the mega redwood sequoia towering with time and wisdom. 

What's the [[philosophy behind the garden]]? 

## Get Started

If you prefer browsing the contents of this site through a list instead of a graph, you see a list of all [setup-related notes](/tags/setup).
