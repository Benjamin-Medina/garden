The philosophical quandary of grades: a conversation I had with Mr. Shapiro, the Dean of Social Studies at MacArthur High School, in San Antonio, Texas. 

The thought is inline with the present movement around [[Ungrading - Reasons for it|"ungrading"]]—reinterpret grading to improve mental health, encourage students, and cultivate knowledge. Mr. Shapiro asked, is it better to be firm and unrelenting in your “late policy,” or understanding, and flexible?

Just as this answer isn’t black and white, so are the rules and procedures that require nuance rather than rigidity. A teacher that is strict on their assignment submissions, such as rejecting anything past a certain number of days, or supplanting full credit, can cause one of two things to happen. 

1) the students toe-the-line and grind through their energies to be prompt  
2) they miss assignments and seldom turn them in due to the reduced grade

What happens at the end of the instructional period, when the student(s) has a poor grade and needs past assignments to proceed? A failing student never looks good on the teacher, but committing to the result might teach a lesson in consequences and the expectations of college; however, the decision may disinterest learners to education entirely.

It might be helpful to accept the fact that [[Grades  are obstacles to navigate]], and the true objective of an educator is to inspire students, to guide them through the various phases of life, and instill a drive for growth and knowledge.
