When reading books, or any material for that matter, don't be afraid to read slowly. Instead of blowing through the content, for completion, allow the material to sink in. This purposeful connection to consumption will aid in turning its information into knowledge. [[Knowledge is our moat]]!

Of course, the extra time for each sentence, paragraph, or book is useless without proper storage - [[Personal Knowledge Management]]. One can channel those notes into a cultivated [[Digital Garden]].
