# Hello
Welcome to my [[notes/Digital Garden]]. A second brain for all my passions and interests - mostly History and Education. A blog, of sorts, to share knowledge, creativity and experience with others.

A fair warning, the landscape is a bit messy - unlike the manicured web spaces we call blogs - digital gardens are intentionally cultivated that way. That means some links may not render correctly, editing might be needed, or the note is basic in content.

What's the [[notes/philosophy behind the garden]]?

Some ideas are only [seeds](/tags/seed) - in the ground, but minimally germinated. They'll start to grow into [saplings](/tags/sapling) - slight foliage adorns these thoughts, produced by pruning and watering. Finally there's [evergreen](/tags/evergreen) - the grandad of the forest, the mega redwood sequoia towering with time and wisdom. 

## Get Started

A great place to start is with my [[notes/Index - Education]]

Perhaps you want to know the inspiration behind note-taking through links and atomicity. In that case, check out the [[notes/Zettelkasten Method]] or [[notes/Note Management]]. 

Oh... you're still here? Well in that case, you want to [[notes/The Roman Empire Fell, but Rome didnâ€™t]] or [[notes/the cultural conditions of television]].
