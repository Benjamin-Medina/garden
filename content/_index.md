# Hello
Welcome to my digital garden. It's a bit messy, but that's the intention. 

Some ideas are only [seeds](/tags/seed) - in the ground, but minimally germinated
They'll start to grow into [saplings](/tags/sapling) - slight foliage adorns these thoughts, but they aren't...
[evergreen](/tags/evergreen) - the grandad of the forest, the mega redwood sequoia towering with time and wisdom. 

What's the [[notes/philosophy behind the garden]]?

## Get Started
