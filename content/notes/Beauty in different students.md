Lately I’ve been anxious about kids that disrupt classes - the students that need additional attention - and the social aspect of high school, as opposed to straight academics; add in the “caring” nature of being a teacher - not simply one’s moral responsibility to be fair, just, and kind to others. I am talking about the task of teachers to detect emotional or mental hardships in their students.

For context, I have directly connected with at least two students while working as a substitute teacher at Johnson High School; both seemed mentally ambiguous. In one case I spoke one-on-one with the student to advise against their dangerous actions and disruptive language. With the other, they sweep the room and asked for anything to do to keep their mind busy. I directed their attention to a book I had with me called the _Humans of San Antonio_. Near the end of the period, I engaged in conversation about the book and their desire to be an occupational interests. 

There are students that might not show a care or effort towards my class work, but that’s likely due to outside forces more than any gripe at my instruction or material. There’s the conditions of life (hardships), or the lack of cultivation in the beauty of learning. Some may never have the latter, choosing to construct industry on their mental landscape, or something else entirely.

Dealing with situations out of the ordinary, or conduct activities outside of the rigidity of lecturing is scary. Yet, those are some of the aspects that make the occupation so rewarding, and produce the worthwhile feelings that only a challenge brings.
