What if student students gathered information through [[Wiki's over books]]? 

Each year students work on a project that would "pay it forward" by working on a wiki together and build an ultimate website that would encapsulate everything they would ever need for the class. [^1]Â 

It's a way of researching a topic, assigning a meaningful assignment, and creating a resource for future courses.
