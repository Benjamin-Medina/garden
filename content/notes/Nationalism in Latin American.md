Isn’t it interesting that nationalism was and still is used by Latin American politics? Because it’s the colonial yoke that divided peoples, while also the catalyst for revolution. Thus, there seems to be a large paradox in the use of nationalism, almost like it’s a shape shifting entity used at the behests of its political opponents. 

Does it matter that Initial Latin American revolutions were started by peninsulars?
