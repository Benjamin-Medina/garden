I feel like my productivity hub search has been ongoing for months - [[Indifferent to Notion]] - maybe even over a year. I fear it may never be done, given its use for getting things done, and my knack to always improve. 

Anyways, I am searching for the following implement. 

* bullet journal task movement
	* Original is too manual, and lacks organization	
* Eisenhower matrix prioritization
* Calendar time blocking / schedule
	* Can't forget what's planned
