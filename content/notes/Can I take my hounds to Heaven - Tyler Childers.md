Tyler Childers is sober now. His music prior to this moment (the release of *Can I take my hounds to Heaven*) was an exploration of, not just artistry, but the practicing of faith in a universalist, rather than strictly baptist, manner. Moreover, the songs were secular, and exploratory of religiously-offish things, such as substances and deep love. 

There's 24 songs in the entire album, wherein 8 of them are produced in three different ways. Symbolically, this creates a trinity of music. Sonically, this (might) be an auditory rendition of the meanings of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit: Hallelujah, Jubilee, and Joyful Noise. 
1) The praise of an almighty, the foundation of all being
	- the songs as originally written
2) The celebration of a period or coming
	- songs similar to the original, with added musicality, such as horns
3) The seemingly irrational recitations of spiritual sounds
	- An almost total recasting of the songs, flesh with electronic and abstract sounds impossibly created by pure casting of an instrument or vocal cord.

If only deep in meaning via words, the album is textually dense by connecting sounds and phrases to trios of divinity.
