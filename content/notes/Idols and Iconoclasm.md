# Medieval Religious Idols
Medieval religion is iconic! Its manuscripts and religious books, like the [[Lindau Gospels]] are decorated and illustrated to an extraordinary degree!
But, there's also *Iconoclasm* which was adopted by commoners and kings alike, as a form of rebellion against the idolatry and grandiose icons of their faith.  

#Question What lines can be drawn from the effort of beautification and the Protestant Reformation?
More broadly, consider the disdain for Catholicism as whole (though not called as such pre-christian split), and meaning of "God'y" as a coinage to luxury, over-abundance, and big material gestures.

Is Protestantism a Christian sect of the commoners? The reason for its wide-spread acceptance?
