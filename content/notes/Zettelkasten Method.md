### Tool to store knowledge

>"Create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection."

[Wikipedia is for information retreival](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#:~:text=Wikipedia%20is%20not%20a%20thinking%20tool%20but%20a%20tool%20for%20information%20retrieval.) (an encylopedia).
Zettlekasten is a **tool for thinking** because of it's "one Zettel per thought" Foundation

- Zettels are like tweets - **short**. Not just informational though, but **knowledge**! 
	- Think about the overwhelming feeling of mass texts and information. It's not conducive to flow nor research based work. 

Connections over content. Relation to others notes, more than just being a note.

____
### Foundation of Zettlekasten
 1) read with a pen in hand and make fleeting notes (that are tied to references)
 2) 2) later make permanent notes in your own words from those fleeting notes that are valuable
 3) 3) spend time thinking about how those permanent notes connect into your existing knowledge and file them accordingly

Check out "The Professor and The Madam" with Mel Gibson.
More so, reflect on the lexicographer who's story the movie tells. 
The zettlekasten-like boxed system for organizing every mention of words as they relate to the formation of the first Oxford dictionary.

Diagram of [[Zettelkasten Method]] like tagging

Index card sized notes

1 | main topic
	1a| related to topic 1
		1a1 | related to topic 1a
			1a1a | related to topic 1a1
2 | topic 2

Of course, the subnotes (categories) are still tied together by the main topic, so the numbering of a note, or name, is relevant after the thoughts been recorded, and when contemplating it's proper place in your **zettels**

I really like the tagging of this -> [Video Link](https://youtu.be/4bxpsvcW2mc?t=433)
The [[Zettelkasten Method]] of tagging via 3a. 3b
	- This is quite similar to bullet journal indexing, which I used immensely, but not for any specific topic but as a quick reference to where the writing continues. 
>Avoid specific topics, instead subcategorize
