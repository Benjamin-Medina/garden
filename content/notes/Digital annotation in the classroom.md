**Tone of annotation:** From studying handwritten annotations on essays, Ball et al. (2009) suggest that when annotating on students’ work, instructors enter a dialogue with students and would need to remain aware about the style, tone and wording used. The tone of annotations may undermine confidence and impact motivation of a learner, therefore constructive, and balanced comments (that helpfully identify areas of weakness as well as positive contributions) were recommended. Digital voice annotations can also help clarify written comments and address tone issues.

**Type of digital annotation:** Since effective feedback is usually specific, timely, and actionable, if tools are used to underline text without further explanation, evidence suggests this has little impact on students and improves their essay writing technique. (Ball et al., 2009). Leveraging assessment criteria, different feedback modes, using comment banks, or adding audio feedback can help contextualize feedback further.""
