Technology is innovative; my application of it, equally ever-changing. The mind is attracted to the latest gadget, widget, or hack. 

Iâ€™d like to reflect on my current technological workflow - my progression of note-taking since diving deep into productivity and [[Kleon2014|Showing your work]]. The process started with the acquisition of the latest iPad; an investment into digital, cloud-stored, notes. My initial excitement was readily tampered by my hands constant fatigue for writing on a computerized display. Albeit, the true depressant came during writing assignment and processing of annotations. Alas, I persisted with my transformation from traditional pen and paper to an Apple Pencil and iPad (equip with a *Paperlike* screen laminate).

Eventually my workload became more intense, most notably my lengthy capstone [[Research Paper HIS]], which requires tremendous processing of dense academic literature. I took a step back, or rather a dive into, the digital academic space; stumbling upon Zotero and Obsidian, and a host of simulating procrastination gadgets. The more I added, the steeper my learning curve became, and the greater the friction between reading and processing information - mostly from the lack of synchronization between apps. 

The cultivation of a flow State is paramount for my scholarly success, so at this junction of hand-writing and typing I'm faced with a conundrum. On the one hand, recording notes and highlighting pdfs on my Ipad is semi-traditional, so affords the least amount of resistance, during and post-consumption. For example, writing in the margin is my prompt action for recording new ideas; an action void in pure digital reading ecosystems. 

On the other hand, I can embrace the typographic way of note-taking; automagically extracting and importing annotations into Obsidian and connecting the information to relevant notes. However, my concern for this workflow is the mass input of unfiltered ideas into [[Personal Knowledge Management]] tool. Will the mixing of academic and daily things produce negative outcomes? Can folders solve this problem without hindering the aesthetic and inherent benefits of Obsidian?
