# [[the catalyst of my stress]] of blogging

What thoughts am I afraid of posting? 
What ideas would not be safe to post to the outside? 
Would I be my true self if my thoughts and ideas were curated? 

- Thought gathered out of feel of starting a blog. 
Who's can see? What are they going to think? Will it come to haunt me? 
Should I care?

I've started to read *Show your Work*, orginally recommended by [[My journey through information|Ali Abdaul]]. I really enjoy its consumption, and the motivating feeling brought from each chapter.

Fear of not doing mangaement right. 
I have lots of thoughts, so content shouldn't be a problem. 
Will I keep checking meatrics, expecting immediate traction?
