“Efficiency” and the theories of competitive advantage are the catalyst's for globalization. Twentieth century scholars were fascinated by the ability of individuals and groups producing at their peak - even phrasing the progress as "global modernity."[^1]

However, the pursuit of “best” output leaves void many other barometers of success. We shifted from assembly line to “knowledge work” (Peter Drucker), whilst still striving for maximum output. Except, the mass of 21st century jobs require difficult computation and cognition unseen in history. 

In sum, the utopia afforded by globalization must steadfastly presently itself, for the betterment of our global society.
