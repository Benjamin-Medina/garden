What is the history of [[time is our greatest resource|time]]-keeping?

When did America enter into a productivity craze? Change our understanding of a daily schedule? Did we always refer to [[time]] so promptly? I believe modern stresses are caused by a the constriction of time on our days, weeks, and months. 

Reflect on the Spanish idea of [[time]] as relative and relate it to our notions of previous  US generations. Ex: footloose, dates meeting times unknown and locations hardly better
