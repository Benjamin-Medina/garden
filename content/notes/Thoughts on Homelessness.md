Why are homeless citizens seen as a stain on the city? 

Sure homelessness isn’t utopian, but the congregation of them in that particular city might be because of the compassion of the government and peoples.

In summary, homeless people shouldn’t be looked down upon, nor the cities that have them. Instead, both should be assisted in solving the problem, not shamed for having it.
