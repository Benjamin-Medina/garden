I found the reactions to present shifts in cultural quite interesting. The page expresses the feelings of board games towards the use of "bad ideas", at least for todays climate.[^1]

Jim Miller from Portland, Oregon took a shot at the game *Pipeline*. In his view the game is a mental simulation of establishing carbon polluting devices into our world. 
>"emulating extremely harmful real-world processes in games"

Can this same gripe be applied to games like Puerto Rico? A colonist themed game with blatantly black planation workers... 

Jan Giesel from Hamburg Germany doesn't think so, framing the whole discourse as a highjacking by the "woke" movement. He (49, white, male) believes the "left-wing alternative" seeks to point fingers and shame him (a man) for who he is. 

Miller claims that the mere practice is an acceptance of the ideas and concepts of the game. Furthermore, human culture is slowly evolves, only shifting by the rate in which it sheds entrenched values, *wrong* or otherwise. 

On March 1, 2022 I checked out Pipeline at my local game store; I can see how it would offend someone. Compare it to a game like “Wildcatters” which is marketed as a playing of 19th century history - which I can get behind - but not necessarily a game of playing out the power grid with oil refinement as the only solution. It’d be better to play Vital Lacerda’s CO2.
