> Sometimes paths are skipped- thought straight to cultivation- like buying a transplant from the nursery. 

##### Seeds
Name stays as Zettel Id.
Connections can be left blank, but always include sources

I will use individual "fleeting" Zettelkasten notes because it 
1) structures my thoughts better
2) removes the need to extract sections at day's end
3) allow connections to form over time, not at day's end
	1) Thoughts may not jump out now, but they will, especially with search function 

##### Cultivation
Notes have been re-read for "worth" and meaningful title
Connections to other notes are made

##### Evergreen
Long-tail notes formed out of multiple cultivates notes. 

The transition too evergreen will be a work in progress, as it means forming seedlings into full trees. Are the deleted afterward? to avoid duplicates?
