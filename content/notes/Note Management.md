### Computate my thoughts to allow, or leverage, technology to improve my output

 1) Easy method for input
	 1) Literature Notes
		 1) Highlighting | writing between the pages
		 2) OR ... Jotting down thoughts as they arise, exclusively
	2) Reference Notes - Free range thoughts and ideas
		1) Recordings most efficient and easy
			* I don't think I'd want to record directly in obsidian, rather record in external app
		2) Index cards or GoodNotes? 
2) Permeant Notes. The curation process of knowledge management 

How does this correlate with Task Management and my Domains? 

>Reflect on your process. Mind maps constructed, literally and mentally. 
> **Form your PKM organically and holistically**

##### Structure 
Another system for *holding* new material might be counterproductive
* The article might not be read (and processed) yet but its content could be picked up by obsidian as a "hey look at me, "I might be useful"
* Maybe that's the beauty of various folders, to allow all data to be in our grasp, but the curated, linked, content is separate
	* For Example
		*  inbox
			- to-read
			- processing

* There's a benefit of quotes. To utilize them later. 
	* If you don't use them, then efficiently mark its place of retrieval. 

### Unique ID's 
Do I have to use them? 
It's the zettlekasten "way", but it's causing friction and seemingly limiting the full impact of Obsidian. 
I'd like to explore the traditional idea of [[Digital Garden]] as such, a progressing of seed from one growing stage to the next. Thus their names are 

### Bi-Directional Linking
Terms and actors are a type of note that doesn't need a link for both ends of the note. 
Instead, reserve the practice for seeds, and ideas conducive to *cultivation* 


I will attempt to use more headers in my notes, especially these daily ones, rather than just separating new ideas by lines. 

This can, and likely will, change with a method of inbox or seed, and the convergence of tasks and everyday use from Obsidian
