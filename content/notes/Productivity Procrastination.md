- How much is the activity a stimuli and how much is anxiety avoidance
	- Dopamine hit or feel-good busy work
	
One way to draw oneself out of the spiraling, uncontrollable cycle is [[mindfulness]]
- Yes this is breathing, meditation, yoga, etc. - but it's basic form is **intention**
- Ask yourself throughout the day, or at least once, why am I doing xyz. For me, I really want to have weekends to myself, to include my wife and kids. That means the more I procrastinate the less I am able to freely, non-shamefully, be present with the people I most want to be around.
