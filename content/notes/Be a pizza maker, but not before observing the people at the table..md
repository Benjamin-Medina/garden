Be a pizza maker, but not before observing the people at the table. 

Donâ€™t even consider business values without recognizing the soul of the wold (and your customer). Conceptualize your users as human beings, and not simply numbers ($ or an order). 

This frame of mind, this shift, can improve the quality of our life and the output of it everyday.
