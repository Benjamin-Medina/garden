Dr. Oppenheimer - key architect for the atom bomb - disdained experimental thought, instead favoring theoretical.[^1] He went so far as to poison a teacher (failed attempted), to dispel the arduous task and mental concepts from his life. He was a physics *theorist,* who seldom touched lab equipment.

I relate to this feeling with my subpar political science grade. My final exam grade was rubricated around the scientific explanation of political systems or actions rather by any theoretical examinations of exam questions. In fact, I perceived one as subjective to the reader, and recorded my answer as such, but was clapped back with a strong comment stating that "philosophical musing" has no place in political science literature.  ^ee0e22

This has all helped me to form the belief that [[Political Science isn't about culture]]

[[multidisciplinary approach to postcolonial studies]]
